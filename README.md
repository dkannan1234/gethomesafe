# GetHomeSafe

An application meant to help people arrive at their destinations with more peace of mind by matching users together based on their travel itinerary. There is an in-built messaging feature that users can communicate with and a map to show their intended travel plans. 

## Run instructions

This app was built using React. To run it, first clone the repository using ```git pull ```. Next, change your directory using ```cd gethomesafe```, then run ```npm install```. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can find a link to download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Finally, run the command ```npm run dev``` and copy the link in the terminal to a web browser to preview the app. 

## Feature showcases

The top bar will allow you to navigate through the prototypes showing each of the technical requirements we will be illustrating. "Hello World" and "Hello Styles" only display the text and styles to be used throughout the project. "Messaging Test" allows users to enter a display name and Room ID, which is saved to an external database. "room" and "demo-room" are two available IDs that can be accessed for the prototype. "Location Test" allows users to share their location once or in real time and scroll around the map. "Mapping Test" allows users to input a start/end location and show the shortest calculated walking path between the two destinations. Three additional demos are included for the prototype.
